List of problems I liked solving. 

Problem 76 : Ultimately turned out to be simple but it took me a while to get on the right track
Problem 83 : start with similar 81 and 82. 83 required a slightly different approach.
Problem 92 : simple ultimately but required 2 insights to speed up
Problem 145 : requires careful analysis and coding but one insight is needed for an efficient solution. Brute force approach won't work. 
Problem 171 : Took few tries to get this right. First find the right set of digits and then permute them to get different unique numbers; permuting was the tricky part
Problem 301: Brute force solution takes too long. Figured out the general approach to speed things up but it took surprisingly long to make sure I got the logic and implementation just write. 
Problem 345 : Wrote a simple implementation first but that never completed. Optimized by building up a solution
