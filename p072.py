# The problem is to find all relatively prime number sets in the give range. S
#  To find relatively prime denominator for a given numerator, we can use approach similar to #70 which requires factoring the number 
#   into prime factors
#   However for this problem (and #70) we need an efficient way to factor a large sequence of numbers.
